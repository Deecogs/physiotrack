No ffmpeg exe could be found. Starting time set to 0.0. Error: No ffmpeg exe could be found. Install ffmpeg on your system, or set the IMAGEIO_FFMPEG_EXE environment variable.
Using HALPE_26 model (body and feet) for pose estimation.

Valid MPS installation found: using ONNXRuntime backend with GPU.

Pose tracking set up for "body_with_feet" model.
Mode: balanced.

Persons are detected every 4 frames and tracked inbetween. Multi-person is not selected. Tracking is done with physiotrack.

Video processing completed.
Processed video saved to /Users/chandansharma/Desktop/workspace/metashape/projects/dc-pose/dochq/physiotrack/physiotrack/Demo/results/demo_PhysioTrack/demo_PhysioTrack.mp4.

Post-processing pose:
- Person 0: Interpolating missing sequences if they are smaller than 10 frames. Large gaps filled with last_value.
Filtering with Butterworth filter, 4th order, 6 Hz.
Pose in pixels saved to /Users/chandansharma/Desktop/workspace/metashape/projects/dc-pose/dochq/physiotrack/physiotrack/Demo/results/demo_PhysioTrack/demo_PhysioTrack_px_person00.trc.

Converting pose to meters:
Using height of person #0 (1.65m) to convert coordinates in meters. Floor angle: auto (estimation: 43.08°), xy_origin: auto (estimation: [0, 683]) px.
- Person 0: Seen from the front.
Pose in meters saved to /Users/chandansharma/Desktop/workspace/metashape/projects/dc-pose/dochq/physiotrack/physiotrack/Demo/results/demo_PhysioTrack/demo_PhysioTrack_m_person00.trc. Also saved in c3d format.

Post-processing angles:
- Person 0: Interpolating missing sequences if they are smaller than 10 frames. Large gaps filled with last_value.
Filtering with Butterworth filter, 4th order, 6 Hz.
Correcting segment angles by removing the 43.08° floor angle.
