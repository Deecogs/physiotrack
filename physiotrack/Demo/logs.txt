Webcam input: the framerate may vary. If results are filtered, PhysioTrack will use the average framerate as input.
Using HALPE_26 model (body and feet) for pose estimation.

Valid MPS installation found: using ONNXRuntime backend with GPU.

Pose tracking set up for "body_with_feet" model.
Mode: lightweight.

Persons are detected every 4 frames and tracked inbetween. Multi-person is selected. Tracking is done with physiotrack.
keypoint_likelihood_threshold=0.3, average_likelihood_threshold=0.5, keypoint_number_threshold=0.3
Skipping right wrist angle computation because at least one of the following keypoints is not provided by the model: ['RElbow', 'RWrist', 'RIndex'].
Skipping left wrist angle computation because at least one of the following keypoints is not provided by the model: ['LElbow', 'LWrist', 'LIndex'].

Video processing completed.
Rewriting webcam video based on the average framerate 8.93614030332535.
Processed video saved to E:\Work\physiotrack\physiotrack\Demo\webcam_20250327_153952\webcam_20250327_153952.mp4.

Post-processing pose:
- Person 0: Interpolating missing sequences if they are smaller than 10 frames. Large gaps filled with last_value.
Filtering with Butterworth filter, 4th order, 4.465837233046153 Hz.

Converting pose to meters:
Person #2 not detected in the video. Calibrating on person #0 instead.
Could not estimate the floor angle and xy_origin for person 0. Make sure that the full body is visible. Using floor angle = 0째 and xy_origin = [640.0, 360.0] px.
Using height of person #0 (1.65m) to convert coordinates in meters. Floor angle: auto (estimation: 0.0째), xy_origin: auto (estimation: [640, 360]) px.
- Person 0: Seen from the front.
Pose in meters saved to E:\Work\physiotrack\physiotrack\Demo\webcam_20250327_153952\webcam_20250327_153952_m_person00.trc. Also saved in c3d format.
- Person 1: Keeping output in 2D because "visible_side" is set to "none" for person 1.
